## Caveats ##

* If you click a button to enable/disable a service, manually refresh a few times until it updates.
* You will likely get a "This site is not secure" banner when you first connect.  This is because I've enabled HTTPS by default with a self-signed certificate.  The reason it is "not secure" is because web browsers prefer certificates to be signed by an authority, not just yourself.  I promise though, HTTPS with a self-signed certificate is way more secure than standard HTTP (don't take my word for it, Google "https vs http") because at least your data is being encrypted this way.  If you care enough, go buy a certificate for a couple of bucks and add it into /etc/ssl/  (you've got root access now).
